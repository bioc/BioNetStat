<p>
    Before running BioNetStat, you must set the execution parameters available on the left sidebar. Below, we detail each differential network analysis parameter.
</p>

<h5>Column classes name</h5>

<p>
  After input, the data variables values data BioNetStat will choose the first character (factor) column to classify the samples. Suppose your dataset has more than one column which labels the sample classes. In that case, it is possible to select which column of classes you want to use.
</p>

<h5>Classes (conditions) being compared</h5>

<p>
    Select the classes you want to analyze with BioNetStat.
</p>

<h5>Gene sets size range</h5>

<p>
    BioNetStat performs tests for each variable set of a collection of sets defined in the <i>Variable set database</i>. If the user inputted no file, the program would analyze only one group with all variables. To test only a subcollection of sets, you can filter the groups according to their sizes (number of variables). It is possible to set the "Minimum gene set size" and "Maximum gene set size" parameters. 
</p>

<p>
    The minimum gene set size allowed is 5. However, we recommend testing groups with at least 15 variables.
</p>

<p>
    Testing large gene sets can take much time. In general, 
    it is feasible to set 1000 or some hundreds of variables as the maximum size. However, this number may vary according to the user's machine specification.
</p>

<h5>Method for network construction</h5>

<p>
The network links are inferred according to a measure of association between the values of the variables. BioNetStat provides three classical association measures:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Pearson: Pearson's correlation coefficient that measures the linear dependence between two variables. For the statistical test, we use the
        Hmisc package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spearman: Spearman's correlation coefficient that measures the monotonic dependence between two variables. For the statistical test, we use the
        Hmisc package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Kendall: Kendall's Tau coefficient. It measures the monotonic dependence between two variables. For the statistical test, we use the psych package.
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Network type</h5>

<p>You can choose between unweighted and weighted networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Unweighted: Graphs where all the edges are weighted by one.
        You must choose a threshold for edge creation. Only edges that connect genes with a higher degree of association than the threshold will be created in the graph.
    </li>
    <li>
        Weighted: Weighted networks are graphs where each edge has a weight defined in section 2d: <i>Set the criterion for network edges weights</i>. The weight of an edge is defined as the association degree between the two gene products connected by it.
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Statistic to link formation</h5>

<p>
The correlation coefficient or p-value obtained by one of the methods mentioned 
above are used to set an association degree for each link of the network. 
The following options are available to measure the association degrees: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Absolute correlation: the absolute value of the correlation coefficient</li>
    <li>1 - p-value: One minus the p-value of the test for dependence between
        two gene products. If the p-value is small, the expression levels are
        tightly associated.</li>
    <li>1 - q-value: One minus the adjusted p-value of the test for dependence 
        between two gene products. The p-value is adjusted by
         the False Discovery Rate (Benjamini and 
        Hochberg, 1995) method for multiple testing.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
  After choosing the association measure, the user has to select the threshold value to links formation.
</p>

<h5>Links weights</h5>
<p>
  If the user selected the weighted option, he also has to choose which measure will be used as the weight of the links (Section 2d: <i>Set the criterion for network edges weights</i>)
).
</p>

<h5>Method for gene networks comparison</h5>

<p>
    BioNetStat compares the correlation networks between the classes for each variable set.  
</p>

<p>Below, we describe the methods available for comparing <i>unweighted</i> networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Spectral distribution test: The spectrum of an undirected graph is the set of eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. The spectrum distribution describes many topological properties of a graph, such as the number of walks, diameter, and cliques. The spectral distribution test is based on the Kullback-Leiber (KL) divergence between spectral distributions (Takahashi <i>et al.</i>, 2012). This test can use it to verify if the same model generated two graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spectral entropy test: It uses the absolute difference between spectral entropies (Takahashi <i>et al.</i>, 2012) to measure the difference in 
        the graph topological organization complexity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree distribution test: The degree of a node is the number of edges that connect to it. The degree distribution test is based on the Kullback-Leiber (KL) divergence between the degree distributions. BioNetStat uses the igraph package implementation of the node degree.
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree centrality test: The degree centrality test
        is based on the Euclidian distance between the degree centralities 
        of the two networks adjusted by the number of vertices.
    </li>
    <li>
        Betweenness centrality test: The betweenness centrality of a node is the number of shortest paths going through it (Freeman, 1979). 
        The betweenness centrality test is based on the Euclidian distance between the betweenness centralities of the two networks adjusted by the number of vertices. BioNetStat uses the igraph package 
        implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Closeness centrality test: The closeness centrality of a node is the inverse of the average length of the shortest paths between it and all the other vertices in the graph (Freeman, 1979). The closeness centrality test is based on the Euclidian distance between the closeness centralities of the two networks adjusted by the number of vertices. BioNetStat uses the igraph package implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Eigenvector centrality test: The eigenvector centrality of a node 
        <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> is the <i>i</i>th value of the first eigenvector 
        of the graph adjacency matrix (Bonacich, 1987). The eigenvector 
        centrality test is based on the Euclidian distance between 
        eigenvector centralities of the two networks adjusted by the number of 
        vertices. BioNetStat uses the igraph package 
        implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clustering coefficient test: 
        The local clustering coefficient of a node is the number of edges between the vertices within its neighborhood divided by the number of edges that could exist among them (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The clustering coefficient test is based on the Euclidian distance between the local clustering coefficients of the two networks adjusted by the number of vertices. BioNetStat uses the igraph package implementation. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    BioNetStat includes generalizations of some of the statistics described above to 
    weighted undirected graphs. Let <i>G</i> be a weighted undirected graph. 
    We define the weighted adjacency matrix of <i>G</i> to be the 
    matrix <i>W = (w)<sub>ij</sub></i>, such that <i>w<sub>ij</sub></i> is the 
    weight of the edge that connects the vertices <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and 
    <i>v<sub>j</sub></i>.
    In this context, 0 &#8804; <i>w<sub>ij</sub></i> &#8804; 1 and <i>G</i> is a full graph.
</p>

<p>Below, we describe the methods available for comparing <i>weighted</i> networks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Spectral distribution test: Replaces the usual adjacency matrix by the
        weighted adjacency matrix, and then performs the spectral distribution 
        test for unweighted networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spectral entropy test: Replaces the usual adjacency matrix by the
        weighted adjacency matrix, and then performs the spectral entropy 
        test for unweighted networks. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree distribution test: BioNetStat generalizes the degree of a node to the sum of the weights of the edges that connect to it (Barrat, 2004). 
        The software uses the igraph implementation of the node strength. 
        It replaces the usual node degree with the weighted degree and
        then computes the degree distribution test for unweighted networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Degree centrality test: Replaces the usual node degree by the weighted
        degree, and then computes the degree centrality test for 
        unweighted networks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Betweenness centrality test: The betweenness centrality of a node is the number of shortest paths going through it (Freeman, 1979). 
        The betweenness centrality test is based on the Euclidian distance between the betweenness centralities of the two networks adjusted by the number of vertices. BioNetStat uses the igraph package 
        implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Eigenvector centrality test: replaces the usual adjacency matrix by the
        weighted adjacency matrix, and then performs the eigenvector centrality 
        test for unweighted networks (Newton, 2004).
    </li>
    <li>
        Clustering coefficient test: replaces the local clustering coefficient of a node by the sum of the weights of the edges between the vertices within its neighborhood divided by the number of edges that could exist among them (Lopez-Fernandez <i> et al. </i>, 2004). Then it performs the clustering coefficient test for unweighted networks.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For the "Spectral distribution test," the "Spectral entropy test," and
the "Degree distribution test" methods, you must select a criterion to
define the bandwidth for the probability density function estimation. The
available methods for computing the bandwidth are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Sturges: the bandwidth is defined as (max(x) - min(x))</sup>/<i>n<sub>bins</sub></i> (Sturges, 1926), where 
        x is the graph spectrum (for the tests based on the spectral density)
        or the node degrees (for the degree distribution test), and
        <i>n<sub>bins</sub></i>=&lceil;log<sub>2</sub>(<i>n<sub>V</sub></i>)
        + 1&rceil;, 
        with <i>n<sub>V</sub></i> denoting the number of genes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Silverman: the bandwidth is defined as 0.9min{sd(x), IQR(x)/1.34}
        <i>n<sub>V</sub></i><sup>-0.2</sup>
        (Silverman, 1986), unless the quartiles coincide,
        where <i>n<sub>V</sub></i> is the number of genes, sd(x) is the standard deviation of x, and IQR is the interquantile 
        range of x, with x denoting the graph spectrum (for the tests based on the spectral density)
        or  the node degrees (for the degree distribution test). If the 
        graph is empty, it is defined as 0.9<i>n<sub>V</sub></i><sup>-0.2</sup>.
    </li>
</li>
</ul>

<p>BioNetStat uses the R 'density' function from the base package for estimating the
probability density function.</p>

<h5>Permutation test settings</h5>

<p>
    To compute a p-value for the differential network analysis, BioNetStat performs 
    a permutation based test, which generates <i>N</i> random permutations of 
    the sample labels.
</p>

<p>
    The minimum possible p-value is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><i>N</i> + 1</sub>. 
    Therefore, the choice of <i>N</i> depends on the required significance level
    of the test. You can set the <i>N</i> parameter on the 
    "Enter the number of label permutations" option.
</p>

<p>
    To perform the same label permutations for all variable sets, you can set a seed to generate the random permutations on the "Enter a seed to generate random permutations" option.
</p>
