<!-- BioNetStat performs statistical tests to identify differentially regulated genes. -->

<p>BioNetStat performs statistical tests to identify differentially correlated variables
sets from
such as gene expression data. Furthermore, it provides tools to 
explore each gene set, such as network visualization, 
ranking of genes according to their "importance" in the 
network, and single gene differential expression analysis.
