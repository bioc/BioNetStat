"Spectral distribution test" "spectralDistributionTest" "" "both" "Bandwidth=Silverman,Sturges#Kernel bandwidth for density estimation. Be aware that Sturges' criteria fails when testing empty networks, and, therefore, your test would not return the p-value. Tests involving unweighted small networks are likely to produce empty graphs. To avoid missing p-values when testing unweighted networks, try to select larger gene sets or use the Silverman's criteria." "Test for Jensen-Shannon divergence between spectral distributions"
